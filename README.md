<h3 align="center">Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET) has been a steady source of highly skilled talent to the nation as well as overseas. A pioneer in engineering education, research and innovation. The team of OWASP Student Chapter, one of the gilt-edged coding society, involves ingenious mind solvers who are eager to make the world a better place to live in with their innovative techniques and discoveries. By successfully organising many hackathons, tech-talks, workshops and coding nights, we have always strived hard to maintain the coding culture throughout the campus.</h3><br>
